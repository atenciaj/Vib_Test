    "explanation": "If the original unbalance causes vibration at 0° (heavy spot at 0° relative to tach), adding a test weight at 180° (opposite the heavy spot) would counteract the original unbalance, thus potentially increasing the overall unbalance effect if not placed correctly or if the initial phase was misread. However, if 'opposite the tachometer' means directly at the indicated heavy spot, it adds to unbalance. Assuming 'opposite' means opposite the heavy spot (which is at 0 degrees), it should decrease. The question phrasing is tricky. If 0° is heavy spot, weight at 180° is correct. If 0° is just the reading and heavy spot is elsewhere, this weight could make it worse."
